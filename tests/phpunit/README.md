##Tests for Citation Bot classes

These tests are implemented in `../../.travis.yml`, and can be performed locally.

To run the tests for Parameter.php (for example), check that PHP is installed and that the
php directory is added to your system `PATH` environment variable, then run the following
command from the command line :

`phpunit --bootstrap /path/to/Parameter.php ParameterTest.php`
